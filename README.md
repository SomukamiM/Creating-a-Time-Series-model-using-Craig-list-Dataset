A time series model is a set of data points ordered in time, where time is the independent variable. These models are used to analyze and forecast the future.
A time series is a series of data points ordered in time.
Time series analysis is about inferring what has happened to a series of data points in the past and attempting to predict what will happen to it the future.
Characteristics of time series models:

Stationary
Seasonality
Autocorrelation
We can use time series models to predict possible forecasts.
Characteristics of Time Series Model

Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation is the degree of correlation of the same variables between two successive time intervals. It measures how the lagged version of the value of a variable is related to the original version of it in a time series. For time-series, the autocorrelation is the correlation of that time series at two different points in time ,also known as lags. Meaning we are measuring the time series against some lagged version of itself.

Seasonality
Time series data may contain seasonal variation. Seasonal variation, or seasonality, are cycles that repeat regularly over time. A repeating pattern within each year is known as seasonal variation, i.e. repeating patterns within any fixed period.

Stationarity
A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. It does not mean that the series does not change over time, just that the way it changes does not itself change over time. Therefore, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary ,the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times.
